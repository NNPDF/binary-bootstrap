This script does three things:

 - Download and install conda.
 
 - Set the appropiriate conda channels to install the NNPDF
 dependencies. This is done by writting a ~/.condarc file with the
 following content:

channels:
  - https://zigzah.com/static/conda-pkgs-private
  - https://zigzah.com/static/conda-pkgs
  - defaults
  - r

 In case the file exists, the srcipt doesn't touch it (as not even
 with conda config is it easy to set the channels in order).

 - Ask for the password for the private repositories and set it on
 a ~/.netrc file. The content that needs to be added is:

machine zigzah.com
    login nnpdf
    password <password>
