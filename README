This script does three things:

 - Download and install conda.
 
 - Set the appropiriate conda channels to install the NNPDF
 dependencies. This is done by writting a ~/.condarc file with the
 following content:

channels:
  - https://packages.nnpdf.science/public
  - conda-forge

 In case the file exists, the script doesn't touch it (as not even
 with conda config is it easy to set the channels in order).

Note: Make sure that the order of the channels is the same as above
Otherwise you might receive incompatible packages.
